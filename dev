Hello hello what's up? Just quickly. I get it at the document doesn't have it. Because the datease have the details we need. Yes. And based on the examples we have, it's that's all we need, correct? Yep. Okay, that's all we need. Then then just based on that, design a prom, so that you can make the changes later on. Okay, uh, just one question that is the design that we have have thought earlier is agent will invoke this audit table to get the last modified date and based on that, it will decide whether to fetch it the data from actual submission ingestion table like actual data conver or or from the spark process the data that is coming from EL am I correct correct the requirement part to make sure that you can make a decision based on a timestamp without any context, right? Mm hmm. You need your check. So I could go and tell you how to implement it, but that doesn't solve the problem, because you need to be able to do this on your own, right? So in this case is that and that's it. If you go to any other company, you know that, that's all they will be telling you. Implement for me for me logic where when data are not refreshed by the user, they are pulled from the original submission, but when the moment the user touches anything in the current system, that's when you start pulling the data from the current system. Okay. That's all they will tell you, and now you have to dig deeper into the understanding and to build the correct logic. No one is going to tell you you this and that that's not how that's a junior developer, in all discussion like that. Yep, yep. So I could answer this for you, but I just don't want to do a century job. Does it make sense? Sure. Got it. So create a prompt or create a design, whatever is okay, then call me to review this, and that's when we will have a discussion, but I just don't want to provide you more details. I just want you to be able to check your think on your own on those topics. Sure. Okay. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. I'll work on it. Should I repeat once again, so that it's easier? Mm what they qual? Yep, please. I understood one second, please. So we want to ensure that we pull the data from original con submission, only if they user has not modified anything associated with that submission in U360 application. Okay. The moment the user modifies something on that submission, the cover payload on its own is no longer sufficient. We need to pull the data at that stage from ut 360 because it has at that stage the latest data. Convore doesn't have those updates. Okay. Sure.. Understood. I'll work on it. Yeah, okay, got it. Okay, ping me when you're ready to review this. I'm still working on those issues. I have partially applied what you have sent. me, just FYI, because I' like some issues and gaps with that approach. in the context of the wider system. But that's still, essentially, so that, you know, whenever there's l an issue, we will know that there is an issue of the communication. But I've changed it in a way, so that when there is an actual issue of the data, that doesn't flag it as an error, because that would be correct, it should actually flag it that the data I'm missing. Oh, okay, yes, yes, yes, that makes sense. Yeah. Yep. Sure. Okay, I will keep you posted as soon as I get over those issues and I can actually launch it without issues, I will merge the code, okay? Okay, sure, sure. Thank you. Thanks, bye. Okay, bye.
